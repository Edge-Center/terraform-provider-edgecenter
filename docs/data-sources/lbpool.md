A pool is a list of virtual machines to which the listener will redirect incoming traffic



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `loadbalancer_id` (String) ID of the load balancer
- `project_id` (Number) uuid of the project
- `region_id` (Number) uuid of the region

### Optional

- `id` (String) lb pool uuid
- `name` (String) lb pool name. this parameter is not unique, if there is more than one lb pool with the same name, 
then the first one will be used. it is recommended to use "id"

### Read-Only

- `healthmonitor` (List of Object) configuration for health checks to test the health and state of the backend members. 
it determines how the load balancer identifies whether the backend members are healthy or unhealthy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--healthmonitor))
- `lb_algorithm` (String) algorithm of the load balancer
- `listener_id` (String) ID of the load balancer listener
- `member` (List of Object) members of the Pool (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--member))
- `operating_status` (String) operating status of the pool
- `protocol` (String) protocol of the load balancer
- `provisioning_status` (String) lifecycle status of the pool
- `session_persistence` (List of Object) configuration that enables the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific backend member. 
this ensures that all requests from the user during the session are sent to the same member. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--session_persistence))
- `timeout_client_data` (Number) timeout for the frontend client inactivity (in milliseconds)
- `timeout_member_connect` (Number) timeout for the backend member connection (in milliseconds)
- `timeout_member_data` (Number) timeout for the backend member inactivity (in milliseconds)
