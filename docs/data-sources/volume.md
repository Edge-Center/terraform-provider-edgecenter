# edgecenter_volume (Data Source)

A volume is a detachable block storage device akin to a USB hard drive or SSD, but located remotely in the cloud.
Volumes can be attached to a virtual machine and manipulated like a physical hard drive.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1
data "edgecenter_volume" "volume1" {
  region_id  = var.region_id
  project_id = var.project_id
  name       = "test-volume"
}

output "volume1" {
  value = data.edgecenter_volume.volume1
}

# Example 2
data "edgecenter_volume" "volume2" {
  region_id  = var.region_id
  project_id = var.project_id
  id         = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

output "volume2" {
  value = data.edgecenter_volume.volume2
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (Number) uuid of the project
- `region_id` (Number) uuid of the region

### Optional

- `id` (String) volume uuid
- `name` (String) volume name. this parameter is not unique, if there is more than one volume with the same name, 
then the first one will be used. it is recommended to use "id"

### Read-Only

- `attachments` (List of Object) the attachment list (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--attachments))
- `bootable` (Boolean) the bootable boolean flag
- `limiter_stats` (Map of Number) the QoS parameters of this volume
- `metadata` (List of Object) metadata in detailed format (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `region` (String) name of the region
- `size` (Number) size of the volume, specified in gigabytes (GB)
- `status` (String) current status of the volume resource
- `volume_type` (String) volume type
