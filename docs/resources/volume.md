# edgecenter_volume (Resource)

A volume is a detachable block storage device akin to a USB hard drive or SSD, but located remotely in the cloud.
Volumes can be attached to a virtual machine and manipulated like a physical hard drive.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1
resource "edgecenter_volume" "volume1" {
  region_id                = var.region_id
  project_id               = var.project_id
  name                     = "test-volume"
  size                     = 20
  source                   = "new-volume"
  volume_type              = "ssd_hiiops"
  instance_id_to_attach_to = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  attachment_tag           = "test-tag"
  metadata = {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2",
  }
}

# Example 2
resource "edgecenter_volume" "volume_image" {
  region_id  = var.region_id
  project_id = var.project_id
  name       = "test-volume-image"
  size       = 20
  source     = "image"
  image_id   = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

# Example 3
resource "edgecenter_volume" "volume_snapshot" {
  region_id   = var.region_id
  project_id  = var.project_id
  name        = "test-volume-snapshot"
  size        = 20
  source      = "snapshot"
  snapshot_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

- `image_id` (String) ID of the image. this field is mandatory if creating a volume from an image
- `instance_id_to_attach_to` (String) VMâ€™s instance_id to attach a newly created volume to
- `metadata` (Map of String) map containing metadata, for example tags.
- `snapshot_id` (String) ID of the snapshot. this field is mandatory if creating a volume from a snapshot
- `volume_type` (String) volume type with valid values. defaults to 'standard'

### Read-Only

- `attachments` (List of Object) the attachment list (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--attachments))
- `bootable` (Boolean) the bootable boolean flag
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `limiter_stats` (Map of Number) the QoS parameters of this volume
- `region` (String) name of the region
- `snapshot_ids` (List of String) snapshots of the volume
- `status` (String) status of the volume

<a id="nestedatt--attachments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `attachments`

Read-Only:

- `attachment_id` (String)
- `server_id` (String)
